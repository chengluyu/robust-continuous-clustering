The following is a possible reorganization of gptoolbox:

- gptoolbox/
  - README.md
  - mesh/  # functions which take (V,F) as input
    - modeling/ # modeling specific shapes/primitives
    - deformation/  #functions related to deformation/skinning
  - geometry/ #functions related to simple geometry operations (not on a mesh)
  - imageprocessing/ 
  - matrix/ #functions for manipulating general matrices, solvers
  - utility/ #functions for making matlab/gptoolbox easier to use
  - data/ #image and mesh files
    - woody.obj
    - hans-hass.jpg
  - external/ #functions not written by us (licenses)
    - matlabPyrTools/
  - mex/ #functions that require a mex compilation
    - README.md
    - selfintersect/
    - winding_number/
    - boneheat/
    - ambient-occlusion/
  - wrappers/ #functions that just wrap command line applications, eventually
    should be mex files...
    - README.md  explain `path_to_*` convention
    - qslim
